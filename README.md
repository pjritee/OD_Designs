# OD_Designs
A collection of previously unknown Orthogonal Designs as listed in the appendices of "Orthogonal Designs Hadamard Matrices, Quadratic Forms and Algebras" by Jennifer Seberry.

An orthogonal design (OD) $X$ of order $k$ and type $(s_1, \dots, s_m)$, $s_i$ positive integers, is a $k \times
k$ matrix with entries $\{0, \pm x_1, \dots, \pm x_m\}$ (the $x_i$ are commuting variables) satisfying
$$
    XX^T=(\sum_{i=1}^m s_i x_i^2) I_k
$$
where $I_k$ is the identity matrix of order $k$. We say that such an $X$ is of kind $OD(k; s_1, \dots, s_m)$.
