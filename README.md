# OD_Designs
A collection of previously unknown Orthogonal Designs as listed in the appendices of "Orthogonal Designs Hadamard Matrices, Quadratic Forms and Algebras" by Jennifer Seberry.

From the introduction of the above book:

An orthogonal design of order $n$, type $(s_1, \dots, s_l)$, $s_i$ positive integers,is an $n \times
n$ matrix with entries from $\{0, \pm x_1, \dots, \pm x_l\}$ (the $x_i$ commuting indeterminates) satisfying:

$XX^T=(\sum_{i=1}^l s_i x_i^2) I_n$
